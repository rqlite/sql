This repository holds a pure Go SQL parser based on the [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)
SQL definition. It implements nearly all features of the language except `ATTACH`,
`DETACH`, and some other minor features.

## Credits
This parser was originally created by [Ben Johnson](https://github.com/benbjohnson). Many thanks to him for making it available for use by [rqlite](https://rqlite.io).
